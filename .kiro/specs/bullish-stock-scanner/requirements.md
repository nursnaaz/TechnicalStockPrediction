# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Bullish Stock Scanner is an MVP system designed to identify potentially bullish stocks through technical analysis. The system fetches stock data from a REST API, calculates core technical indicators, scores tickers based on bullish signals, and presents ranked results through both a backend API and a React frontend. The MVP focuses on essential indicators (SMA, EMA, MACD, Volume, Relative Strength) with a streamlined scoring methodology to deliver actionable insights within a 2-hour development timeline.

4. WHEN the external API returns an error response, THE REST_API_Client SHALL log the error and retry the request up to 3 times with exponential backoff
5. IF the external API is unavailable after 3 retry attempts, THEN THE REST_API_Client SHALL mark the ticker as unavailable and continue processing remaining tickers
6. THE REST_API_Client SHALL cache fetched data in memory for the duration of the Scan_Session
7. WHEN a Scan_Session is initiated, THE REST_API_Client SHALL fetch data on-demand for each ticker as it is processed

### Requirement 2: Universe Building

4. WHEN the market index 50-day SMA is within 2% of the 200-day SMA, THE Market_Regime_Analyzer SHALL classify the regime as neutral
5. THE Market_Regime_Analyzer SHALL return the market regime classification (bullish, bearish, or neutral)

### Requirement 4: Technical Indicator Calculation

8. THE Scoring_Engine SHALL calculate the total Bullish_Score as the sum of all earned points with a maximum of 100
9. IF any indicator is unavailable, THEN THE Scoring_Engine SHALL assign 0 points for that indicator and continue scoring with available indicators
10. THE Scoring_Engine SHALL return the Bullish_Score and contributing indicator signals for each ticker
